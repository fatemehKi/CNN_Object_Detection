# image_detection_deep_learning
In this notebook we will build image recognition algorithm. we build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 80+ % accuracy on 
cat vs. non-cat datasets. We Worked with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks and we
minimize the cost function and derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
